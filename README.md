I had a lot of fun doing this project as it's been years since I've written any html or css. Flexbox for instance, completely brand new thing to me. Still learning and ironing out the wrinkles, as this rough draft will show. All in all not too shabby for a few hours of work. I would say my weaknesses with this project in particular is I should have started with the entire body in a flexbox and worked from that instead of using the text-align:center tag. Creating another container simply to center the Call to Action section seems like a bit of a waste, but hey it's a learning process I'll so I'll take the wins where I can get them. Looking forward to continuing this course.
